# Implements several types of propensity-score matching, balance diagnostics for group characteristics, average treatment effect estimates, and bootstraping to estimate standard errors of ATE estimates.
# <p>
# Propensity scoring methods:<br>
# <b>One-to-one:</b> Matches individuals in the treatment group to a single individual in the control group.  Variations include whether or not controls are matched with replacement, whether or not a caliper should be used, and the scale of the caliper.
# <br>
# <b>One-to-many:</b> Matches individuals in the treatment group to as many individuals in the control group as possible, subject to some criteria.  Variations include whether or not controls are matched with replacement, caliper methods as in one-to-one matching, and k nearest neighbor matching.
